280. You can use EMR to run Apache Spark jobs on demand on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), without needing to provision EMR clusters, to improve resource utilization and simplify infrastructure management.
281. Amazon EKS gives you the flexibility to start, run, and scale Kubernetes applications in the AWS cloud or on-premises. 
282. Amazon EMR on EKS, you can share compute and memory resources across all of your applications and use a single set of Kubernetes tools to centrally monitor and manage your infrastructure.
283. Amazon EMR is available on AWS Outposts, allowing you to set up, deploy, manage, and scale EMR in your on-premises environments, just as you would in the cloud.
284. AWS Outposts brings AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility.
285. Analyze events from Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, or other streaming data sources in real-time with Apache Spark Streaming and Apache Flink to create long-running, highly available, and fault-tolerant streaming data pipelines on EMR. Persist transformed data sets to S3 or HDFS and insights to Amazon Elasticsearch Service.
286. Use EMR's built-in machine learning tools, including Apache Spark MLlib, TensorFlow, and Apache MXNet for scalable machine learning algorithms, and use custom AMIs and bootstrap actions to easily add your preferred libraries and tools to create your own predictive analytics toolset.
287. EMR can be used to quickly and cost-effectively perform data transformation workloads (ETL) such as sort, aggregate, and join on large datasets.
288. Analyze clickstream data from Amazon S3 using Apache Spark and Apache Hive to segment users, understand user preferences, and deliver more effective ads.
289. EMR Notebooks provide a managed analytic environment based on open-source Jupyter that allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to prepare and visualize data, collaborate with peers, build applications, and perform interactive analyses.
290. EMR can be used to process vast amounts of genomic data and other large scientific data sets quickly and efficiently. Researchers can access genomic data hosted for free on AWS.
